I decided to choose javascipt and jQuery because that is what i am most familiar with so far,
it is what we have learned so far so i decided to stick to what i knew even though it was definitely 
hard to learn it using ajax. When playing with the HTMX code and trying it out that way i found a lot more problems
and stuggled with it until it just didnt work at all. I then switched over to javascipt and jquery to make my code work.
